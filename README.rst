Python bindings to the OpenStack Keystone API
=============================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Keystone API. There's a Python API (the
``keystoneclient`` module), and a command-line script (``keystone``). The
Keystone 2.0 API is still a moving target, so this module will remain in
"Beta" status until the API is finalized and fully implemented.

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in
the `OpenStack wiki`_.  The master repository is on GitHub__.

This code a fork of `Rackspace's python-novaclient`__ which is in turn a fork of
`Jacobian's python-cloudservers`__. The python-keystoneclient is licensed under
the Apache License like the rest of OpenStack.

Python API
----------

By way of a quick-start::

    # use v2.0 auth with http://example.com:5000/v2.0")
    >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
    >>> keystone = client.Client(username=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD, tenant_name=TENANT, auth_url=KEYSTONE_URL)
    >>> keystone.tenants.list()
    >>> tenant = keystone.tenants.create(name="test", descrption="My new tenant!", enabled=True)
    >>> tenant.delete()


Command-line API
----------------

Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``keystone``, that you
can use to interact with Keystone's Identity API.

You'll need to provide your OpenStack tenant, username and password. You can
do this with the ``--os_tenant_name``, ``--os_username`` and ``--os_password``
params, but it's easier to just set them as environment variables::

    export OS_TENANT_NAME=project
    export OS_USERNAME=user
    export OS_PASSWORD=pass
    unset SERVICE_TOKEN
    unset SERVICE_ENDPOINT

Also note that SERVICE_TOKEN and SERVICE_ENDPOINT environment variables (discussed
below) must be unset for user-based authentication to be enabled.

You will also need to define the authentication url with ``--os_auth_url`` and the
version of the API with ``--identity_api_version``.  Or set them as an environment
variables as well::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:5000/v2.0
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=2.0

Alternatively, to authenticate to Keystone without a username/password,
such as when there are no users in the database yet, use the service
token and endpoint arguemnts.  The service token is set in keystone.conf as
``admin_token``; set it with ``service_token``.  Note: keep the service token
secret as it allows total access to Keystone's database.  The admin endpoint is set
with ``--endpoint`` or ``SERVICE_ENDPOINT``::

    export SERVICE_TOKEN=thequickbrownfox-jumpsover-thelazydog
    export SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://example.com:35357/v2.0

Authentication via service token and endpoint will be preferred when one or
both of the SERVICE_TOKEN and SERVICE_ENDPOINT environment variables are
defined.

Since Keystone can return multiple regions in the Service Catalog, you
can specify the one you want with ``--region_name`` (or
``export OS_REGION_NAME``). It defaults to the first in the list returned.

You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running
``keystone help``::

    usage: keystone [--os_username OS_USERNAME] [--os_password OS_PASSWORD]
                    [--os_tenant_name OS_TENANT_NAME]
                    [--os_tenant_id OS_TENANT_ID] [--os_auth_url OS_AUTH_URL]
                    [--os_region_name OS_REGION_NAME]
                    [--identity_api_version IDENTITY_API_VERSION] [--token TOKEN]
                    [--endpoint ENDPOINT]
