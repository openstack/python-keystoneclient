    :param string cert: Path to the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) file which

                        needed to established two-way SSL connection with

                          contains the trusted authority X.509 certificates
                          needed to established SSL connection with the
                          identity service. (optional)
    :param boolean insecure: Does not perform X.509 certificate validation

    :param dict auth_ref: To allow for consumers of the client to manage their
                          own caching strategy, you may initialize a client
                          with a previously captured auth_reference (token)
    :param boolean debug: Enables debug logging of all request and responses
                          to keystone. default False (option)

    .. warning::

        If debug is enabled, it may show passwords in plain text as a part of
        its output.


    The client can be created and used like a user or in a strictly
    bootstrap mode. Normal operation expects a username, password, auth_url,
    and tenant_name or id to be provided. Other values will be lazily loaded
    as needed from the service catalog.

    Example::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> keystone = client.Client(username=USER,
        ...                          password=PASS,
        ...                          tenant_name=TENANT_NAME,
        ...                          auth_url=KEYSTONE_URL)
        >>> keystone.tenants.list()
        ...
        >>> user = keystone.users.get(USER_ID)
        >>> user.delete()

    Once authenticated, you can store and attempt to re-use the
    authenticated token. the auth_ref property on the client
    returns as a dictionary-like-object so that you can export and
    cache it, re-using it when initiating another client::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> keystone = client.Client(username=USER,
        ...                          password=PASS,
        ...                          tenant_name=TENANT_NAME,
        ...                          auth_url=KEYSTONE_URL)
        >>> auth_ref = keystone.auth_ref
        >>> # pickle or whatever you like here
        >>> new_client = client.Client(auth_ref=auth_ref)

    Alternatively, you can provide the administrative token configured in
    keystone and an endpoint to communicate with directly. See
    (``admin_token`` in ``keystone.conf``) In this case, authenticate()
    is not needed, and no service catalog will be loaded.

    Example::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> admin_client = client.Client(
        ...     token='12345secret7890',
        ...     endpoint='http://localhost:35357/v2.0')
        >>> admin_client.tenants.list()
