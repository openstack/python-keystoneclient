    :param string username: Username for authentication. (optional)
    :param string password: Password for authentication. (optional)
    :param string token: Token for authentication. (optional)
    :param string tenant_id: Tenant id. (optional)
    :param string tenant_name: Tenant name. (optional)

    :param string region_name: Name of a region to select when choosing an
                               endpoint from the service catalog.
    :param string endpoint: A user-supplied endpoint URL for the keystone
                            service.  Lazy-authentication is possible for API
                            service calls if endpoint is set at
                            instantiation.(optional)
    :param integer timeout: Allows customization of the timeout for client
                            http requests. (optional)
    :param string original_ip: The original IP of the requesting user
                               which will be sent to Keystone in a
                               'Forwarded' header. (optional)
    :param string cert: If provided, used as a local certificate to communicate
                        with the keystone endpoint. If provided, requires the
                        additional parameter key. (optional)
    :param string key: The key associated with the certificate for secure
                       keystone communication. (optional)
    :param string cacert: the ca-certs to verify the secure communications
                          with keystone. (optional)
    :param boolean insecure: If using an SSL endpoint, allows for the certicate
                             to be unsigned - does not verify the certificate
                             chain. default: False (optional)
    :param dict auth_ref: To allow for consumers of the client to manage their
                          own caching strategy, you may initialize a client
                          with a previously captured auth_reference (token)
    :param boolean debug: Enables debug logging of all request and responses
                          to keystone. default False (option)

    .. warning::

    If debug is enabled, it may show passwords in plain text as a part of its
    output.


    The client can be created and used like a user or in a strictly
    bootstrap mode. Normal operation expects a username, password, auth_url,
    and tenant_name or id to be provided. Other values will be lazily loaded
    as needed from the service catalog.

    Example::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> keystone = client.Client(username=USER,
                                     password=PASS,
                                     tenant_name=TENANT_NAME,
                                     auth_url=KEYSTONE_URL)
        >>> keystone.tenants.list()
        ...
        >>> user = keystone.users.get(USER_ID)
        >>> user.delete()

    Once authenticated, you can store and attempt to re-use the
    authenticated token. the auth_ref property on the client
    returns as a dictionary-like-object so that you can export and
    cache it, re-using it when initiating another client::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> keystone = client.Client(username=USER,
                                     password=PASS,
                                     tenant_name=TENANT_NAME,
                                     auth_url=KEYSTONE_URL)
        >>> auth_ref = keystone.auth_ref
        >>> # pickle or whatever you like here
        >>> new_client = client.Client(auth_ref=auth_ref)

    Alternatively, you can provide the administrative token configured in
    keystone and an endpoint to communicate with directly. See
    (``admin_token`` in ``keystone.conf``) In this case, authenticate()
    is not needed, and no service catalog will be loaded.

    Example::

        >>> from keystoneclient.v2_0 import client
        >>> admin_client = client.Client(
                token='12345secret7890',
                endpoint='http://localhost:35357/v2.0')
