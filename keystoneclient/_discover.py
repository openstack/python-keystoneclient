"""The passive components to version discovery.

The Discover object in discover.py contains functions that can create objects
on your behalf. These functions are not usable from within the keystoneclient
library because you will get dependency resolution issues.

The Discover object in this file provides the querying components of Discovery.
This includes functions like url_for which allow you to retrieve URLs and the
raw data specified in version discovery responses.
