    Originally deployments of OpenStack would contain a versioned endpoint in

    a different version like v3.0 as there is no way to tell where it is
    located. We cannot simply change all service catalogs either so there must
    be a way to handle the older style of catalog.

    This function adds a rule for a given service type that if part of the URL
    matches a given regular expression in *old* then it will be replaced with
    the *new* value. This will replace all instances of old with new. It should
    therefore contain a regex anchor.

    For example the included rule states::

        add_catalog_version_hack('identity', re.compile('/v2.0/?$'), '/')

    so if the catalog retrieves an *identity* URL that ends with /v2.0 or
    /v2.0/ then it should replace it simply with / to fix the user's catalog.
